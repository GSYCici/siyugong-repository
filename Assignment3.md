# Link to the Original Data Visualization

I selected this data visualization because the graph is not too complicated to understand, and the flaws of this graph are also obvious. In addition, it reflects the Average Income per Capita in Brazil, which is meaningful.

# First Redesign Process

I found that the labels in the graph are overlapped seriously, which makes audiences hard to read. And the legend is at the bottom of the graph. Because the colors for each age category are similar, it's hard to match the lines with the legend.
Thus, I decided to redesign 2 thing: 1.I expanded the scale of y-axis, so that the labels won't be overlapped anymore. 2.I made the legend on the left of the graph, with the order corresponding to the lines' order.
