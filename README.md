This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me
Hello! I am Siyu Gong, a 2nd year MSPPM student in Carnegie Mellon University. I come from China, and graduated from Shanghai University of International Business and Economics before I came to Heinz College.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn the data visualization skills, and how to design a good and intuitive chart to help audience understand the data. After graduation, I plan to work as a data analyst, so this course can help me a lot.
