## How the Divorce Rate Has Changed over the Last 100 Years

What do you think is the divorce rate of American families in recent years? I bet that only few people know that the divorce in America has been falling fast in recent years, 
and it just hit a record low in 2019. For every 1,000 marriages in 2019, only 14.9 ended in divorce, according to the newly released American Community Survey data from the Census Bureau. 
This is the lowest rate in 50 years. 

However, although the divorce in America just hit a record low, it still much higher than that in many other countries.

Using one years data may not be convincing enough to compare the ratio of divorces by countries, so I will show you the trend of divorces since last century.

From this chart, we can find that the divorce rate in the US has fluctuated violently from 1920 t0 2018. The reasons are related to the history and cultural development of the United States.

* The Reason behind this Fluatuation
  * During World War I, women entered the workforce when the US joined  World War II. They gained more independence and freedom, leading to a higher divorce rate in the US. In 1940, the rate was 2 divorces per 1,000 people, but reached 3.4 in 1947. 
  * In The 1950s, the idea of the nuclear, All-American Family was created, which emphasized the family unit and marriage. Thus the divorce rate dropped again to 2.3 per 1,000 people in 1955. 
  * During the 1960s, women started to close the education gap and the US started to seek more progressive politics. As a result, women sought more independence, causing the divorce rate to rise significantly. In 1969, the rate jumped to 3.2 per Americans.
  * The 1970s were categorized by free love. People paid less attention on coupling and marriage, so the divorce rates rose dramatically. In this decade, divorce rate reached an all-time high. In 1970, the rate was 3.5, and by 1979, the rate was 5.3 per 1,000 American, with 1,193,062 divorces that year.  
  * After that peak, the rate continued to decline rapidly. TIME reports that older generations continue to get divorced, however, since the younger generation is getting married later in life and approaching marriage differently, the divorce rates dropped. 
  * The decline in the divorce rate is likely to continue in 2021, despite the pandemic. Evidence found that the pandemic let some couples closer to each other. According to data from the American Family Survey, a majority of married Americans said that the pandemic has made them appreciate their spouse more and agree that their commitment to marriage has deepened.

## The Duration of Marriages that End in Divorce

Have you ever heard about "The seven-year itch", which means that happiness in a marriage or long-term romantic relationship declines after around seven years.
Therefore, how long have the couples took from loving each other to hating becomes to an interesting study to test this saying.

From this chart, we can generally say that "The seven-year itch" is probably true in America. Because the median duration of marriages that end in divorce is around 7 for nearly two centuries. And we can also generally conclude that the countried with lower divorce rate will also have longer duration of marriages that end in divorce.

  - For European countries, the data comes from the Eurostat dataset.
  - For the US the series is composed of data taken from three sources: Carter et al. (2006) for the period 1920 - 1995; the US Census Bureau (2007) for the period 1996 - 2004; and the CDC for the period 2005 to present.
  - For other non-European countries that are OECD members, the data comes from the OECD Family Database.
  - For all other countries the data comes from the UN World Marriage Database






A lower divorce rate means longer marriages. According to the new Census data, the median duration of current marriages in the U.S. has increased almost one year in the recent decade, from 19 years in 2010  to 19.8 years in 2019.
