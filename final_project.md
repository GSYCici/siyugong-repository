## **From sweet Vows to Broken Families** 

What do you think is the divorce rate of American families in recent years? I bet that only few people know that the divorce in America has been falling fast in recent years, 
and it just hit a record low in 2019. For every 1,000 marriages in 2019, only 14.9 ended in divorce, according to the newly released American Community Survey data from the Census Bureau. 
This is the lowest rate in 50 years. 

However, although the divorce in America just hit a record low, it still much higher than that in many other countries.

Data Source: 
- For European countries, the data comes from the Eurostat dataset.
- For the US the series is composed of data taken from three sources: Carter et al. (2006) for the period 1920 - 1995; the US Census Bureau (2007) for the period 1996 - 2004; and the CDC for the period 2005 to present.
- For other non-European countries that are OECD members, the data comes from the OECD Family Database.
- For all other countries the data comes from the UN World Marriage Database






A lower divorce rate means longer marriages. According to the new Census data, the median duration of current marriages in the U.S. has increased almost one year in the recent decade, from 19 years in 2010  to 19.8 years in 2019.
