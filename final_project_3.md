# Divorce - From Sweet Vows to Broken Families

## Summary of My Work for 3 Parts of Final Project

### Part I

1. I thought about the data and story that I can choose for my final project. At first, I thought about the migration route of migratory birds, and I looked for the websites about the Animals' protection. But I found that it's hard to find the data. Thus, I looked for the data of mental disorders from this website: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool
2. After collecting all the data that I need, I made the outline of my final project. (The outline is in the Github page for the part I)
3. Based on this outline, I decided several elements of my final project, which are Brief introduction of the mental health disorders; Data visualizations; Telling the story from the data visualization; and Calling on society to pay more attention to mental health.
4. Because the data visualizations are important for this project, I made the initial handed sketches for my data and story.
5. After that, I documented the data source that I will use, and how I plan to use in the Github page.
6. Finally, I wrote a few paragraphs to summarize my approach to the project.

### Part II

1. I got the feedback for my first part of final project, and it seemed that my project is not like a story, but a data visualization. I noticed that the trend lines of the depression rate for most countries are just straightly upward, which have no fluctuation. Thus, it's hard for me to tell the story of this depression data. So I decided to change my topic.
2. I remembered I have read an interesting paper about the factors lead to the divorce, so I searched the data and research for the divorce. I found there are many things that I can talk about in this topic, so I decided to choose divorce as my final project topic.
3. After collecting all the data and research, I did the data visualization first. I used different data source to make the various charts, including the divorce rate comparison among countries; the trend of divorce rate for different countries from 1920s to 2018; the duration of marriages that end in divorce; the professions impact on divorce rate; the average age of women at marriage; and the relational mobility associated with more frequent gift exchangs. I made these chart in Tableau, Flourish, Photoshop and Powerpoint. It took me a long time to clean and filter the data, and made the clear and pretty charts.
4. After having the data visualization, I started building my GitHub page. First, I wrote an outline of the storyboard, just like I did in part I, but with the different topic. Than I editted the GitHub page based on that outline. I added text for analyze and explain the charts in the page, and also referenced the research from experts. I cited the reference and data source.
5. I realized that the storyboard is still like a data visualization, but not a story. So I tried to use an imaginary characteristic, Lily, to be the role of the story, and made up some background for her. So that she can be the role who facing the divorce with her husband, and searching the information which actually I searched. So this can be a story for the project.
6. Next, I started looking for the appropriate pictures that I can use in my storyboard. I referenced the library's guide to ensure I am using images correctly. I looked for the pictures in Unsplash and Google. I chose the pictures that have no copyright.
7. And then, I set a list of questions for the interview, and sent them to my interviewees. 
8. After all of them gave me the feedback, I put their feedback into my GitHub page. Based on that feedback, I decided to do several improvements, and wrote them in GitHub page. 
9. I improved all the things that I plan to revised in Part II, so that I will have plenty of time to focus on designing the final storyboard in the last week.

### Part III

##### Changes that I made

I already done everything that I planned to change in Part II, so what I have in part II is not the initial one before the interview and feedback, but the revised one after the feedback, and those changes that I did in part II were:
  - Adding an guidance at the top of the repository, but I didn't keep the guidance in my final project in Sharthand, because that's a little bit weird of having that. 
  - Informing audiences that some of the charts are interactive, so I added the text of "This image is interactive" behind the title of the charts. 
  - Making image in a brighter color. 
  - Labeling the images with their title after "Image x". Initially, I titled the chart with "image x", but interviewees said the title should describe the chart, so I added the meaningful title after the "image x".

##### Target Audiences

The target audience for my final data story is all those people who are interested in the topic of marriage, for both male and female, married person and unmarried person. And according to the feedback, all the interviewees were interested in this data story. Thus, I think this is the appropriate target audience.

##### The Work that I did in Part III

1. I chose a template in Shorthand, and put the text, charts, and images into that template. I designed that storyboard for a long time to make it more attractive. However, I found that transition of two section is stiff between two sections with the different pictures as their background. So I decided to use another template to redo it again.
2. I found another template which have a transition section between main sections, and editted the storyboard again.
3. I put all the citation of reference below the text, and put the data source at the end of the story. I also added the links of the pictures to them.
4. I wrote the initial presentation draft, and tried to present once. And I found that was too much over the 2 mins, so I cut content again and again to make sure I can present them within 2 mins.
5. I summarized my work log of the final project during the three weeks, and put in in my GitHub page of part III.

##### Learning from This Final Project

From this project, I learned that the interactive chart should be marked clearly for that function, so that the audience won't miss that function or be confused about that. I also learned that the images should be titled with their content, but not just a number below.

##### References for Materials Used

I have already listed all the references in my story in Shorthand, and I list them again here:
