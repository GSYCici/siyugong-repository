1. I thought about the data and story that I can choose for my final project. At first, I thought about the migration route of migratory birds, and I looked for the websites about the Animals' protection. But I found that it's hard to find the data. Thus, I looked for the data of mental disorders from this website: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool
2. After collecting all the data that I need, I made the outline of my final project. (The outline is in the Github repository for the part I)
3. Based on this outline, I decided several elements of my final project, which are Brief introduction of the mental health disorders; Data visualizations; Telling the story from the data visualization; and Calling on society to pay more attention to mental health.
4. Because the data visualizations are important for this project, I made the initial handed sketches for my data and story.
5. After that, I documented the data source that I will use, and how I plan to use in the Github repository.
6. Finally, I wrote a few paragraphs to summarize my approach to the project.
